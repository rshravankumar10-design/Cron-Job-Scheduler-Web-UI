# Cron-Job-Scheduler-Web-UI
📌 Overview
The Cron Job Scheduler Web UI is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of creating, managing, and monitoring cron jobs. Instead of manually editing crontab files or running commands in the terminal, users can visually configure their cron jobs through an interactive and user-friendly interface.
🚀 Features
	•	🖥 User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive web dashboard to schedule, edit, and delete cron jobs easily.
	•	⏰ Custom Scheduling: Supports full cron expressions for flexible time scheduling (minute, hour, day, month, weekday).
	•	🔍 Job Monitoring: View running, completed, and failed jobs in real time.
	•	📄 Logs & Status: Displays output and error logs for each job execution.
	•	🔐 Authentication (optional): Secure login system to manage access.
	•	🔄 Persistent Storage: Jobs and logs are stored in a database (e.g., SQLite/MySQL).
	•	⚙ Backend Integration: Supports backend automation scripts written in Python, Node.js, or shell.
🧩 Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React / Vanilla JS)
	•	Backend: Python (Flask / Django) or Node.js (Express)
	•	Database: SQLite / MySQL
	•	Scheduler: Cron / APScheduler / Node-cron

📊 How It Works
	1.	User creates a new job by specifying:
	•	Command/script to run
	•	Schedule time (via cron expression or dropdown fields)
	•	Job description
	2.	Scheduler service parses and executes the job automatically at the defined time.
	3.	Logs and job status are recorded in the database.
	4.	Web UI updates dynamically to reflect running and past jobs.
